\title{The geom_timeline function}
\usage{
geom_timeline(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
}
\description{
Used in conjunction with GeomTimeline.
See the layout contained within the course materials p.g. 452
Here the layout of this function is very similar.
This geom looks to chart a timeline of earthquakes for a given country / countries
with points (in the example) representing earthquake events, point size indicating
earthquake magnitude and colour representing number of deaths. x (the date) is a
required aesthetic whereas y (country) is optional.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 df <- df_earthquakes \%>\% filter(COUNTRY \%in\% c("CHINA", "USA"), YEAR > 2000)
 ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = COUNTRY,
                color = as.numeric(TOTAL_DEATHS),
                size = as.numeric(EQ_PRIMARY),
                label = CLEAN_LOCATION_NAME)) +
   geom_timeline() +
   labs(size = "Richter scale value", color = "# deaths") +
   theme(panel.background = element_blank(),
         legend.position = "bottom",
         axis.title.y = element_blank()) +
   xlab("DATE")
}
